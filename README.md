# Advent of Code 2025
These are my solutions to the problems of [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/).

This is also my first project written in [Go](https://go.dev/). I am using this to learn a new language, so this code will not be optimal in any sense of the word. </br>
If I get bored, I might implement some task more efficiently (probably not in Go, but in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) or C).
## Usage
All Go solutions should be runnable through `go run`ning the file. For each solution you should be able to provide your input inside each days solution-folder in a `input.txt` file.
### Example usage:
```sh
go run ./day1/solver.go
```

## Current completion status 2025
